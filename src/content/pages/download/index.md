## Join the millions already enjoying Kodi

Kodi is available as a native application for Android, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS and Windows operating systems, running on most common processor architectures. A small overview of the features can be found on our about page. For each platform, we offer a stable and development release(s). For normal users we recommend installing the stable releases.

## Select Your Platform

Kodi has many flavours, our developers have worked hard to make it support a large range of devices and operating system. We provide final as well as development builds for future final release versions. To get started, simply select the platform that you want to install it on.

## Older Releases

Please note, development of the v20 "Nexus" line has ended. If you discover a bug in v20, please test if the bug is also present in v21 "Omega" and submit your bug report for v21 if present. While we do not recommend using old builds, you can [download an old build](http://mirrors.kodi.tv/releases/) from our mirrors site if you need to.

## Source Code

Current development is done in our git repository. The source can be viewed online, downloaded, or cloned from our github repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git
```
