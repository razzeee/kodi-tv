> I took some time to update our website to the lastest tech - so we're now running gatsby 5 and actually creating blog posts should hopefully be a little more streamlined now.

### Core

Kodi core

[enen92](https://matrix.to/#/@_slack_teamkodi_U2L8G7U2V:matrix.org) reports

> Work towards changing the default windowing system in macOS from SDL to native windowing has continued to progress well this month. Changes include the support of HiDPI (retina) displays (not available before in SDL) as well as couple of other minor improvements and generic fixes. We're getting close to a point where we'll be certainly asking you for general feedback if you are an avid macOS Kodi user before considering the switch. So, keep an eye on the macOS section of the forum!

# Thatâ€™s all for now!

See you next time!
